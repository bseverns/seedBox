## [Unreleased]

- Audio fixture recordings and reference spectra are still on the wishlist.
  Expect them to land once we lock in the signal chain.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-05-28

### Added
- First hardening pass on build docs and test scaffolding, making it easier for
  newcomers to spin up the lab without frying their patience.
- Release playbook documentation so we stop improvising tagging rituals at 2am.

### Security
- Audited PlatformIO dependencies and tightened native test defaults so the
  sandbox stays hermetic.
