// Sampler owns a deterministic voice pool shared between hardware and the
// native simulator. The intent: **any seed rendered in rehearsal behaves the
// same on stage**. This header is deliberately chatty so the DSP class can be
// taught straight from the source code.
//
// Major ideas baked into this sampler:
// - "Voice" means one currently playing sample. We only keep four to make it
//   painfully obvious when voice stealing happens.
// - Every attribute comes from the Seed genome (`Seed::env*`, `Seed::tone`,
//   etc.), so deterministic reseeding is as easy as re-running the scheduler.
// - Hardware and native builds share the same bookkeeping. The hardware build
//   wires a Teensy Audio graph; the native build keeps the data-only shell so
//   unit tests and notebooks can inspect state without an SGTL5000 nearby.
