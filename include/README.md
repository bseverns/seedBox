# Public headers â€” the promises SeedBox makes

Everything in here is treated as a contract. These headers are the shared
vocabulary between the firmware core, the native sim, and whatever scripting
harness you bolt on next. We keep them lean, loud, and well-documented so other
repos (looking at you, MOARkNOBS-42) can depend on them without spelunking
source files.

## Files at a glance

- `HardwareConfig.h`
  - Pin maps, codec wiring, and feature flags. Update this first when hardware
    shifts, then mirror the change in the README pin tables.
- `Seed.h`
  - The canonical seed genome. Every engine, display snapshot, and test uses
    this struct, so annotate new fields heavily. Teach the reader why each
    parameter exists.
- `BuildInfo.h`
  - Auto-generated by `scripts/gen_version.py`. Provides git hash + build time so
    the firmware can shout its identity over serial.

## Contribution checklist

1. Document new symbols inline. Assume the reader is smart but sleep-deprived.
2. Keep hardware-dependent constants fenced behind `SEEDBOX_HW` when possible so
   the native build stays truthful.
3. If you add or rename a field, update the docs (`README.md`, roadmaps, tests)
   the same day. Intent drift is the enemy.

Treat this folder like the interface spec you wish someone handed you.
