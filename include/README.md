# Public headers â€” promises in plain language

Everything in `include/` is a handshake between different parts of SeedBox (and
any curious side projects). Treat these headers like a reference zine: skim a
file to understand the vocabulary before diving into implementation details.

## Quick tour

| File | Why it's here | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HardwareConfig.h` | Pin maps, codec wiring, feature flags. | Update this first when the physical build changes, then jot the change in docs. |
| `SeedBoxConfig.h` | Build-time switches (`QUIET_MODE`, etc.). | Check this before adding a new flag; document the story in docs. |
| `Seed.h` | The official seed genome shared by engines, displays, and tests. | Add comments when you introduce new fields so future readers know the musical intent. |
| `BuildInfo.h` | Auto-generated by `scripts/gen_version.py`. | Lets the firmware shout its git hash and build time over serial. |

## Working guidelines

- Keep declarations small and obvious. If something looks magical, add a doc
  comment or link to the doc that explains the trick.
- Wrap hardware-only details in `#if SEEDBOX_HW` so the native build can still
  include these headers without drama.
- When you rename or add a struct field, update the nearby README/test/doc so the
  story stays consistent.
- Call out supporting flags in comments: `QUIET_MODE` keeps logs tame for
  waveform captures in `out/`, while `ENABLE_GOLDEN` helps tests file evidence in
  `artifacts/`.

Headers may feel formal, but they're just another way of teaching future you
what the system expects.
