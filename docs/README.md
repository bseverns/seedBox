# SeedBox documentation staging ground

Welcome to the paper trail. If the firmware repo is the synth, this folder is
the zine you flip through on the bus ride to the gig. Every doc aims to teach,
not intimidate.

## What's inside

| File or folder | What you'll learn | Best time to read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `builder_bootstrap.md` | Environment setup, wiring diagrams, lab ideas. | When you're booting hardware or helping a friend get started. |
| `hardware_bill_of_materials.md` | Shopping list + sourcing lore for the physical rig. | Before you smash the "buy" button. |
| `roadmaps/` | Long-form design notes for current and future engines. | When you're planning a feature or trying to understand the vision. |
| _(future add-ons)_ | Calibration guides, wiring art, troubleshooting logs. | Whenever the community uncovers new stories worth sharing. |

Suggested starting points in `roadmaps/`:
- [`roadmaps/granular.md`](roadmaps/granular.md)
- [`roadmaps/resonator.md`](roadmaps/resonator.md)

## How we keep docs alive

- Update the matching doc the moment you change a code contract. Treat it like a
  lab notebook entry: date it, explain it, link to the change if possible.
- Capture experiments, even the weird ones. Future readers learn as much from
  the dead ends as the successes.
- Speak like a mentor, not a gatekeeper. Assume the reader is smart, curious,
  and maybe brand-new to embedded audio.

Clarity keeps the jams inclusive. Write like you're inviting someone to sit in
on the next session.
